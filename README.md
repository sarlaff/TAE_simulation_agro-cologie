Agroecological Transition Scenarios Simulation




Overview

This project simulates agroecological transition scenarios using GAMS to evaluate economic and productivity outcomes across different farm sizes. It is designed to support data-driven decision-making for agricultural policies and sustainable farming strategies.

The simulation covers three farm size categories:

Small farms: < 5 ha

Medium farms: 5–20 ha

Large farms: > 20 ha

The model tests three main transition scenarios:

Progressive reduction of pesticides

Crop diversification

Recycling of animal organic matter

Cross-scenarios combining the above approaches

Objectives

Simulate diverse agroecological transition strategies

Assess impacts on economic performance

Compare outcomes across different farm sizes

Provide a decision-support tool for policymakers and stakeholders

Methodology

Tools: GAMS language / GAMS software

Approach: Techno-economic optimization and scenario simulation, integrating economic risk and minimizing deviations.

Key Indicators

Labor productivity

Gross margin

Input consumption

Savings on input costs
